# IP List for VPN Guard

Don't want to start fresh and start calling APIs? Well, you can get some IPs from here and throw them in your `cache` file after initial startup.

We have the IPs broken down into the VPN service they're provided from.

Feel free to add to it. It's open to everyone! If you have a `cache` from your server, make a folder with the server address (or name) and put the IP list inside.
